# Detection-of-Malaria-using-image-processing
The repo contains a notebook created as part of a course project, i.e. BIO 221/ STATS 366, at Stanford University


## Details About the Project
The project was about the detection of malaria using cell images dataset. I worked with the instructor and tried different strategies for the detection of malaria. In the end, using the color information, particularly the green channel, helped us in identifying the cells which were infected. We could also have used deep learning which might have resulted in a better accuracy, but since the project was more aimed at learning, I decided to not use deep learning and instead focused more on machine learning and image processeing techniques.
